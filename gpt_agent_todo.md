# Goal
Create a new package called `turbo_firestore_api` by extracting and migrating the existing Firestore API logic from the current package.

# High Priority Manual User Tasks
(None at the moment)

# Plan & Progress
- [x] Step 1: Create new package structure
  - ✓ Created new directory `turbo_firestore_api`
  - ✓ Set up basic package files using `flutter create --template=package`
  - ✓ Added dependencies using Flutter CLI:
    - cloud_firestore
    - turbo_response
    - fake_cloud_firestore (dev)
  - ✓ Verified all direct dependencies are up-to-date

- [ ] Step 2: Analyze and document current code structure
  - Map out all relevant files and their dependencies
  - Identify which code needs to be migrated
  - Document any external dependencies

- [ ] Step 3: Migrate core code
  - Move API code
  - Move abstracts
  - Move models and utilities
  - Update imports and dependencies

- [ ] Step 4: Set up tests
  - Migrate existing tests
  - Update test dependencies
  - Ensure test coverage

- [ ] Step 5: Documentation and cleanup
  - Update README with usage instructions
  - Add API documentation
  - Clean up any remaining references
